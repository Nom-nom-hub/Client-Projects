## Project Cost: $100

### Cost Breakdown and Explanation

The $100 price point represents exceptional value for this project, considering:

- **Custom SVG Animation Development ($35)**  
  The animated truck required specialized SVG knowledge and multiple iterations to ensure proper functionality across browsers.

- **Responsive Website Design ($25)**  
  Complete mobile-friendly layout with proper spacing, typography, and component sizing for all screen sizes.

- **Dark Mode Implementation ($20)**  
  Full theme switching capability with local storage for user preferences and smooth transitions between modes.

- **Customer Service Widget ($20)**  
  Interactive chat interface that maintains consistent styling with the rest of the site in both light and dark modes.

This price point is significantly lower than market rates (which would typically range from $500-1500 for similar work) because:

1. We've used efficient development techniques
2. The project leveraged some existing components that were customized
3. The scope was clearly defined and executed without feature creep

The result is a professional, modern website that effectively showcases Meemaw's Pickup and Delivery services while providing an excellent user experience at an affordable price point.
